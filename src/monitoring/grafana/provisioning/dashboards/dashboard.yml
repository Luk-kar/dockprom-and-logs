# NOTE:
# Dashboard display order in Grafana folders is determined by dashboard title, sorted alphabetically.
# To enforce a custom order, this project uses invisible Unicode characters (such as zero-width spaces) as prefixes in the "title" field of each dashboard's JSON.
#
# Example:
#   "\u200Bdocker-logs"           # U+200B Zero Width Space (appears first)
#   "\u200Cmonitor_services"      # U+200C Zero Width Non-Joiner
#   "\u200Ddocker_containers"     # U+200D Zero Width Joiner
#   "\u2060docker_host"           # U+2060 Word Joiner (appears last)
#
# WARNING:
# - This is a workaround; invisible characters may be stripped or mishandled by some tools or editors.
# - Searching for dashboards by title may be confusing, as the invisible prefix is not visible.
# - Document any changes to dashboard titles carefully to avoid confusion.
#
# If you wish to change the display order, adjust the invisible Unicode character at the start of each dashboard title accordingly.
